Hi!

We understand you are having a problem with rclone or have an idea for an improvement - we want to help you with that!

If you've just got a question or aren't sure if you've found a bug then please use the rclone forum

    https://forum.rclone.org/

instead of filing an issue.  We'll reply quickly and it won't increase our massive issue backlog.

If you think you might have found a bug, please can you try to replicate it with the latest beta?

    https://beta.rclone.org/
    
If you can still replicate it with the latest beta, then please fill in the info below which makes our lives much easier.  A log with -vv will make our day :-)

If you have an idea for an improvement, then please search the old issues first and if you don't find your idea, make a new issue.

Thanks

The Rclone Developers
